# Cypress and Playwright Testing Demo

This project demonstrates end-to-end testing for a web application using Cypress and Playwright. Below are the key areas covered, along with the suggested number of tests for each area.

## Key Areas to Cover

### Basic Navigation and Page Load

Test that critical pages load correctly.

- **Example:**
  - Verify the homepage loads successfully and contains expected elements.
  - Check that the About page loads and displays relevant information.
  - Ensure the Contact page loads and shows the contact form.

### Form Interactions

Test that forms can be filled out and submitted.

- **Example:**
  - Login form: Verify that valid credentials allow user login.
  - Registration form: Ensure new users can register successfully.
  - Contact form: Check that the form can be filled out and submitted, and a success message is displayed.

### User Authentication

Test user login, logout, and registration.

- **Example:**
  - Valid login: Verify successful login with correct credentials.
  - Invalid login: Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed for incorrect credentials.
  - Logout: Verify that the user can log out successfully and is redirected to the login page.

### CRUD Operations

Test create, read, update, and delete operations for key resources.

- **Example:**
  - Create a new post: Ensure a new post can be created and is displayed in the list.
  - Edit a post: Verify that an existing post can be edited and changes are saved.
  - Delete a post: Check that a post can be deleted and no longer appears in the list.
  - View a list of posts: Ensure the list of posts loads correctly and displays all posts.

### UI Elements

Test that critical UI elements function correctly.

- **Example:**
  - Dropdowns: Verify that dropdown menus open and can be interacted with.
  - Modals: Check that modal dialogs open, close, and function as expected.
  - Buttons: Ensure buttons perform their intended actions when clicked.
  - Links: Verify that links navigate to the correct pages.

### Error Handling

Test that the application handles errors gracefully.

- **Example:**
  - Invalid input: Ensure error messages are displayed for invalid form inputs.
  - 404 errors: Verify that a custom 404 page is displayed for non-existent routes.
  - Server errors: Check that server errors are handled and appropriate messages are shown to the user.

### Performance and Load Time

Optionally, test that pages load within acceptable time limits.

- **Example:**
  - Measure the load time of critical pages and ensure they meet performance criteria.

## Suggested Number of Tests

For a strong demo, showcasing around 10-15 well-chosen tests should be sufficient. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- **Basic Navigation and Page Load:**
  - 2-3 tests
- **Form Interactions:**
  - 2-3 tests
- **User Authentication:**
  - 2-3 tests
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - 3-4 tests
- **UI Elements:**
  - 2-3 tests
- **Error Handling:**
  - 2-3 tests

## Example Tests

### Basic Navigation and Page Load

1. Verify the homepage loads correctly.
2. Ensure the About page loads and contains specific content.

### Form Interactions

1. Test successful login form submission.
2. Verify that the registration form can be filled out and submitted.

### User Authentication

1. Test a valid login scenario.
2. Check that an invalid login shows the correct error message.
3. Verify that a user can log out successfully.

### CRUD Operations

1. Create a new post and verify it appears in the list.
2. Edit an existing post and ensure changes are saved.
3. Delete a post and confirm it no longer appears in the list.

### UI Elements

1. Verify that dropdown menus function correctly.
2. Ensure that modals open and close as expected.

### Error Handling

1. Check that invalid form inputs show appropriate error messages.
2. Verify that a non-existent route displays a custom 404 page.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of your application's functionality and ensures that critical aspects are well-tested.
